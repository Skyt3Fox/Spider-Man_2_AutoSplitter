# Spider-Man_2_AutoSplitter
Open AutoSplit Misc fof starting the run open pete and miles both seperate from each other there should be 3 AutoSplits in total
make a settings.toml for all three in the folder labeled settings. you use misc to tart and end the timer and it'll automaticly start the other two Autosplits.
make sure in the settings 1_pete and 2_miles loop last split image to first image is enabled.
then play the game and test out the autosplitter. there should be a spider-man 2 ps5 livesplit file.
link the folders with images to the Autosplit apps.

get Autosplitter the app here --> https://github.com/Toufool/AutoSplit/releases/tag/v2.2.0
